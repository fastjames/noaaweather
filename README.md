As described in the exercise in Chapter 13 of _Programming Elixir_:

In the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
provides hourly XML feeds of conditions at 1,800 locations.[ 24] For example,
the feed for a small airport close to where Iâ€™m writing this is at
http://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KDTO.xml.
Write an application that fetches this data, parses it, and displays it in a
nice format.
(Hint: You might not have to download a library to handle XML parsing.)
